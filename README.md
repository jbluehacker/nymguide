========

A guide to constructing a persistent identity online which is not connected to your "real" name, or legal identity.

Some topics to adress:
* motivations, user models
* ethics (real anonymity means anonymity for *anyone*)
* threat models, legal environment
* TOS
* practices ("tradecraft")
* tools (infratructure, a'la tor, and direct, a'la email, chat, encryption, etc)
* infrastructural problems (spam spam spam poisens the well)
